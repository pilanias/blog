Hello World! üëãüèæ My name is **Ondiek Elijah Ochieng**. I‚Äôm a **Software Engineer**, **a technical article writer** and a **community advocate**.

As an active member of the tech community, I have made significant contributions through my roles as an author at SheCodeAfrica, Nairobi, a visual designer at Lux Tech Academy, a gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, GDSC Lead, and AWS Community Builder. Additionally, I share my expertise as an author for [Educative Inc](https://www.educative.io/) and [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/). Through these roles, I strive to empower and inspire individuals to learn and grow in the tech ecosystem.

During my years of professional development, I've been able to gain professional and practical knowledge of the following programming languages and tools.

**Languages:** I am proficient in `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `Python`, `JavaScript (ES6), GraphQL`, and `SQL`.

**Frameworks:** My experience extends to `Flask, FastAPI, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap5, TailwindCSS,` and `Material UI`.

**Version Control and CI/CD:** Masterful use of `Git, GitHub` & `GitLab`, coupled with experience in implementing continuous integration and deployment using `CircleCI` and `GitHub actions`.

**Cloud Platforms:** Proficient in deploying, managing, and operating applications using `AWS, Azure,` and `Digital Ocean.`

**Containers and Message Brokers:** Practical knowledge of containerization with `Docker` and managing asynchronous messaging with `RabbitMQ`.

**Databases:** When it comes to databases, I have robust experience with SQL databases like `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL`, as well as NoSQL databases like `MongoDB`.

**Operating Systems:** I am comfortable working in a `Linux` environment and understand the nuances of this powerful operating system.

**Architectures and APIs:** I have a firm grasp on different architectures such as `Microservices`. I've also developed APIs using both `REST` and `GraphQL` protocols.

**Testing:** To ensure quality, I leverage automation testing tools like `Cypress, Pact, Pytest, Jest, React Testing Library, Chai`, and `Mocha`.

**Headless CMS:** Familiar with `Sanity` and `HygraphCMS` for flexible and scalable content management.

**Technical Writing:** Last but not least, I'm a seasoned `technical writer`. I believe that the ability to communicate complex ideas in an understandable way is a vital skill for any developer.

The world of tech is boundless and ever-evolving. I am committed to continuously learning, sharing, and growing alongside it. Looking forward to the journey ahead!
